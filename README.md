Getting down with tests

Description:

As a user I should be able to select my starting and ending locations from a drop down.

When the user clicks the start button the application should determine the length of time it would take to travel.

The application will then record and report the time every 10 seconds until the stop button is pressed.

The average time will be displayed at the bottom of the page.

Acceptance Criteria:

Users can select a start and ending location from a dropdown.

The start button is only enabled when both start and ending destination fields are populated.

The stop button should only be enabled when the process is running.

While the process is running, the user can not edit the destination and origin location until stopped.

While the process is running, the time to travel will be output to screen at an interval.
